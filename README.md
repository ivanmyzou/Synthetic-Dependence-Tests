# Synthetic-Dependence-Tests
This repository provides all files needed to reproduce the results in the thesis **Synthetic Dependence Tests Based on Deep Learning**.

## List of Files:

- **depstats.rar** : R package source for the package depstats.
- **sample generations.rar** : R codes used to generate txt files that represent the features (requires installation of the package depstats).
- **models.rar** : python Keras model files that store the trained parameters for the synthetic dependence tests (can be read with python codes).
- **results.rar** : python files that can be used to produce the powerplots shown in the thesis as well as more detailed numerical results (require the used of python library for machine learning Keras as well as the Keras model files and txt files for features in the same directory).
