# Synthetic-Dependence-Tests
This repository provides all files needed to reproduce the results in the thesis **Synthetic Dependence Tests Based on Deep Learning**.

- **depstats.rar** : R package source for the package depstats.
- **sample generations.rar** : R codes used to generate txt files that represent the features (requires installation of the package depstats).
- **models.rar** : python Keras model files that store the trained parameters for the synthetic dependence tests (can be read with python codes).
